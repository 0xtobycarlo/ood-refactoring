Starting hints
- What do each of the methods do? are they well named? Definitely not! Start by giving them better names and then take a look at the parameters
- What about the variable names in the methods?
- Can you see any magic numbers in the code? Could they be stored as constants instead?

Intermediate hints
- Could the loops that find films and screens be moved to a new method?
- What about the code that checks for the time being valid?

Advanced hints
- Time validation and addition could be moved in to it's own class
